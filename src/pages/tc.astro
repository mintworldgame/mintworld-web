        MintWorld Game is a distributed application launched by Not Gonna Make
        It S.L, currently running on the Polygon Network, that combines
        traditional core game and blockchain mechanics. This Site and App are
        only an interface allowing participants to own, transfer, battle, and
        develop unique digital monsters as well as the ability to own land plots
        and other items (collectively referred as Game NFTs). The game’s native
        token, MWG, is a multifunctional utility token which serves as in-game
        currency for economic interactions and as governance token influencing
        decision making. Users are entirely responsible for the safety and
        management of their own private Polygon wallets and validating all
        transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval.
        Furthermore, as the MintWorld Game smart contract runs on the Polygon
        Network, there is no ability to undo, reverse, or restore any
        transactions. This website and its connected services are provided “as
        is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. By using this Site
        you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions
        involving Not Gonna Make It S.L.
